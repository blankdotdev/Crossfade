Crossfade is an Android app that opens any music link in your preferred streaming service - regardless of what your friends use. It seamlessly redirects song and album links from any platform to another, ensuring a smooth listening experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Universal Link Handling**: Support for Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, Deezer, Soundcloud, and more.
- **Smart Redirection**: Uses the Odesli API to find the equivalent track on your preferred service.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If an exact match isn't found, Crossfade performs a smart search (Title + Artist) to find the best match.
- **Share Sheet Integration**: Redirect links directly from the Android Share Sheet—no more manual copying and pasting.
- **History & Favorites**: Keep track of resolved links for quick access.

## 🛠️ Configuration

To get the most out of Crossfade, set it as your default link handler for the music apps you don't use:

1.  Open **Crossfade** and navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Tap on **"Set As Default"**.
3.  In the System Settings, ensure "Open supported links" is enabled.
4.  Select the domains you want Crossfade to handle (e.g., `open.spotify.com`, `music.apple.com`).

## 📥 Installation
